This repository includes scripts for the computational models and the generation of the corresponding figures from the publication titled "Undoing of firing rate adaptation enables invariant population codes"

The experimental data will be available upon request during the revision process and be publicly available after publication.


The file PopulationCode Fig1_Fig8.ipynb has the code corresponding to the simulations on the population code shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 8. 

The file Firing_rate Fig6_SupFig2.ipynb has the code corresponding to the simulations of single PN neurons shown in Fig. 6 and in the Sup. Fig. 2
